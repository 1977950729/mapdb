MapDB
========

MapDB provides concurrent TreeMap and HashMap backed by disk storage or off-heap-memory.
It is a fast, scalable and easy to use embedded Java database engine. It is tiny (160KB jar),
yet packed with features such as transactions, space efficient serialization, instance cache
and transparent compression/encryption. It also has outstanding performance rivaled only by
native embedded db engines.
